# Service

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.24

In this specific project, I tried to implement blueprint services. that contains the following content.

Services-Blueprint-Character

Blink components - for setting the values of variable like eye hydration and blinking also check that if the character can see or not.
the player character has an input blueprint for different inputs from the player.

Enemy - Enemy ai component
Blackboard and behaviour tree

Two services find the target to find the character on the map.
So only when a character moves towards the front of an enemy. The enemy can see the player/find the player.

Can move this is for if the player has eyes open enemy will not move but when the player blinks it will start moving.

Enemy Character component for movement and location.

Widgets contain the animation for blinking for a character.
